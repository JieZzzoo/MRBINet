# MRBINet
This repository is about the work of Multi-Strategy Region and Boundary Interaction Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. 

üèÉ The code is on the way...... üèÉ

## Datasets
The datasets utilized in this work can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg) (extraction code:2r9f), including ORSSD, EORSSD, ORSI-4199 and RSISOD.

## Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MRBINet-Res2Net in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lQ6wDX3vByzc3JnptE7diQ) (extraction code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199, MRBINet-ResNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ROaR-UFW89nC77rFGm4GWw) (extraction code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD, MRBINet-VGG in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1j7gzwL-mw3VVbdtH0XrG5g) (extraction code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD.

We also provide saliency maps on DUTS, ECSSD and HKU-IS which can be found from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RX9txFf_lqHBv0e-k5O9mcIQpw6-r36r/view?usp=sharing), or [Baidu Drive] (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YVItg_y8dHwtRqgCafVngw) (extraction code:MRBI)
## Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
