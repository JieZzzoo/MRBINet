# MRBINet
This repository is about the work of Multi-Strategy Region and Boundary Interaction Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images. 

üèÉ The code is on the way...... üèÉ

# Datasets
The datasets utilized in this work can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg) (code:2r9f), including ORSSD, EORSSD, ORSI-4199 and RSISOD.

# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MRBINet-Res2Net in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lQ6wDX3vByzc3JnptE7diQ) (code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD and ORSI-4199, MRBINet-ResNet in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ROaR-UFW89nC77rFGm4GWw) (code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD, MRBINet-Res2Net in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1j7gzwL-mw3VVbdtH0XrG5g) (code:MRBI) on ORSSD, EORSSD

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
